HTML Structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
<html lang="en">: The root element of the HTML document, indicating that the language is English.
<head>: Contains metadata about the HTML document.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Sets the viewport properties for responsive design.
<title>HTML Form</title>: Sets the title of the HTML document.
Styles are embedded within a <style> tag.
<body>: Contains the content of the HTML document.


CSS Styling:

The <style> tag contains CSS rules for styling the form and its elements.
The body has a background color, and the form is styled with a white background, padding, border-radius, and a box shadow.
Form elements like labels and inputs have specific styling for layout and appearance.
An animation (fadeIn) is defined to gradually make the form visible.
Form Structure:

The <form> element has an ID (myForm) and an onsubmit attribute, calling the submitForm function when the form is submitted.
Labels and input fields are provided for name, email, and age. The "name" and "email" inputs are marked as required.


JavaScript:

A <script> tag contains JavaScript code.
The submitForm function is defined to handle the form submission.
event.preventDefault() prevents the default form submission behavior.
The function retrieves values from the name, email, and age fields, creates a JSON object, converts it to a formatted JSON string, and creates a Blob (binary large object) containing the JSON data.
A dynamically created link (<a>) is used to download the Blob as a JSON file.
